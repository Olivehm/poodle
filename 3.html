<p>The Poodle does shed, but instead of the fur coming off the dog, 
it becomes tangled in the surrounding hair. This can lead to matting without proper care. 
Texture ranges from coarse and woolly to soft and wavy.
Poodle show clips require many hours of brushing and care per week, 
about 10 hours/week for a Standard Poodle. </p>

<p>Poodles are usually clipped down into lower-maintenance cuts as soon as their show careers are over. 
Pet clips are much less elaborate than show and require much less maintenance. 
A pet owner can anticipate grooming a Poodle every six to eight weeks. 
Attention must be paid to a poodle's ears, because hair grows in their ears.</p>

<p>They should be cleaned religiously with a solution and hair should be removed, 
so that earwax buildup does not accumulate and moisture does not take hold, 
both causing infection. Some claim that poodles are hypoallergenic.</p>
