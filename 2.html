<h3>Appearance</h3>

<p>The Poodle is an active, athletic breed with the different breed varieties varying predominantly by their size.
The Fédération Cynologique Internationale's breed standard states the Standard Poodle 
stands between 45 and 62 centimetres (18 and 24 in), the Medium Poodle between 35 and 45 centimetres (14 and 18 in),
the Miniature Poodle between 28 and 35 centimetres (11 and 14 in) and the Toy Poodle 24 and 28 centimetres (9.4 and 11.0 in);</p>

<p>some kennel clubs do not recognise the Medium Poodle variety, they typically state the Standard Poodle stands 
between 38 and 60 centimetres (15 and 24 in) and Miniature Poodle between 28 and 38 centimetres 
(11 and 15 in), with the toy variety remaining unchanged.</p>

<p>A healthy adult Standard Poodle typically weighs between 20 and 32 kilograms (44 and 71 lb), 
a Medium Poodle between 15 and 19 kilograms (33 and 42 lb), a Miniature Poodle between 12 and 14 kilograms (26 and 31 lb)
and a Toy Poodle between 6.5 and 7.5 kilograms (14 and 17 lb).</p>
