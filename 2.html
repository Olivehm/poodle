stands between 45 and 62 centimetres (18 and 24 in), the Medium Poodle between 35 and 45 centimetres (14 and 18 in),
the Miniature Poodle between 28 and 35 centimetres (11 and 14 in) and the Toy Poodle 24 and 28 centimetres (9.4 and 11.0 in);</p>

between 38 and 60 centimetres (15 and 24 in) and Miniature Poodle between 28 and 38 centimetres 
(11 and 15 in), with the toy variety remaining unchanged.</p>
